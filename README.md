# Holidayz Exam Project

My final exam for my 2 years of Front-end Study at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Testing E2E CYPRESS

The project includes one spec with two tests, login and logout.  
To run tests, first, you need to run the live server. This is done by the following command:

```
npm run start
```

Once the project is running, you can open a second terminal and run the following command:

```
npm run cypress:run
```

The tests should now be running in your terminal and displaying successful 2 out of 2 tests.
