# Holidayz Exam Project

My final exam for my 2 year Frontend Study at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Testing E2E CYPRESS

The project includes one spec with two tests, login and logout.  
To run tests, first you need to run liveserver. This is done by the following command:

```
npm run start
```

Once the project is running, you can open a secondary terminal and run the following command:

```
npm run cypress:run
```

The tests should now be running in your terminal and displaying succesfull 2 out of 2 tests.
